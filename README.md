# DSDNet-official
This repository contains official implementation of our ACM MM 2025 paper "DSDNet: Raw Domain Demoiréing via Dual Color-Space Synergy", by Qirui Yang, Fangpu Zhang, Yeying Jin, Qihua Cheng, Peng-Tao Jiang, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang.

## Introduction
We propose a kernel-free matching strategy by matching between LR-center and LR-corner, which avoids the resolution gap between the LR and Ref in Dual-Lens Reference-Based SR task.
